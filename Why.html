        <h>Why?</h>
        <p>Games are so interesting to me because if you give a person the same game, they could both have two entirely different experiences. <br>
        If I gave two different people a copy of Grand Theft Auto V, they could both have a desire to do different things. <br> <br>
        Maybe one of them immediately went on to start stealing cars, running people over and causing mayhem. <br>
        Maybe the other one just played golf, or went hiking and took in the views.
        <br> <br> Two entirely different experiences, despite being given the piece of media. <br> Gaming, if the developers allow it to be, can be a unique form of expression. </p>
