        <section>Games have had a long extensive history.
            In October 1958, Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, similar to the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house.
            Regretfully, after its three days of popularity, it was dismantled and largely forgotten about
        until the late 1970s where it was the subject of a legal battle.

         <p> After that, things had quietened down until Pong came around, manufactured and released by Atari in 1972. 
            Pong exploded in popularity, it is recognized as one of the earliest arcade video games and one of the earliest successful video games commerically. 
            It kickstarted the industry, with a lot of companies beginning to create 'clones' which mimicked its design.</p>

         <p> It wouldn't be for another 30 years or so until we started seeing fully 3D games. </p>
