        <p>Gaming is new. It has quite a while to go before it can boast of having a century's worth of media to sift through; like the film and music industry has. 
        Yet, despite its infancy, I find it to be one of the most impressive forms of entertainment out there.<br>
    Gaming allows a level of interactivity and expression from the user that isn't possible in other forms of media. It's also one that manages to consistently provide people with accomplishment.<br>
   Games can be found anywhere. You can play them on your computer, mobile, your consoles. You can even play them in your browser, via HTML. </p>
